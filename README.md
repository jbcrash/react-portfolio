This is a portfolio website I am building with react and tailwind css to host case studies from my Google UX Design course, Python course I have taken and new projects I am continuing to work on. 
The portfolio will also include basic about information, and an interactive CV.
I hope to have he site feature selectable colour schemes, advanced scrolling animations, and maybe even a little 3D animation using three.js, but we will see as the project develops.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
